1. Introduction 

﹛﹛﹛pyCSAMT is open source sotfware under GNU Lesser General Public License, it 
can  freely redistributed and modify as the terms of licence statements. The software is  
geophysic software and 'crossroad' between geophysic and geology. It is written in   
Python and mainly focused on Controlled source audio-frequency magnetotelluric 
(CSAMT) as  its acronym name  shows. its code is open source and developed as a flexible 
toolbox, which would be dynamically extend in future within the academic geophysics＊ 
community.
﹛﹛﹛CSAMT method in geophysic community is well-established resistivity exploration 
tool and used for the detection in deep geological structure and has sprung up in recent 
years. it's broadly applied in a diversity of exploration problems Sandberg and Hohmann, 
1982; Bartel and Jacobson, 1984; Bromley, 1993; Wannamaker, 1997a, 1997b;  Susilawati 
and Mustopa, 2019), mineral (e.g., Kellett et al., 1993; Thurlow, 1993, An and Di, 2010; 
Chen et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2013), and hydrocarbon (e.g., Zonge and 
Hughes, 1991) . Some companies have also applied this method in exploring the 
groundwater resources (e.g., Bernard and Vachette, 1990; Fu et al., 2013;  Ghorbani et al., 
2018; Giroux, B., M. Chouteau, 1997) as well as mapping the fault-zones  (e.g., Asch and 
Sweetkind, 2011; Kouadio et al., 2020) with promising results.
 
2. Why this software ? 
Despite the fame of CSAMT method, the data processing is relatively few in literature  
and typically software is not available for academic use. Most of the data processing  
software in the field of CSAMT is paid for by private companies (eg : Zonge International 
Engineering  http://zonge.com/etc ). there is no unified software as open source software 
for CSAMT data processing and interpretation in the academic community. We, therefore, 
introduce pyCSAMT toolbox that allows handling, processing and imaging of CSAMT data 
sets. Furthermore, besides CSAMT standard data processing we introduce a novelty 
though incorporating a special sub-package called ＆geodrill＊ which mainly deals with 
geological informations, existing wells logs as well as borehole data obtained from field 
and/or special firms to improve geophysical interpretation. 

3. Purpose of software
Firstly , pyCSAMT is intended to solve the problem of unified open source software 
leakage , consequently  we create a different packages to overcome the data processing 
and the lack of open souce software to convert  raw data collected on the field (*avg 
format from Zonge International Company , *.j format from AG jones (Jones, 1980) to 
conventional Electrical Data Interchange(SEG) (*edi format) most convenient and 
recommended by geophysics  community for widely use and officiously process by other 
softwares. As well as the project ongoing, pyCSAMT included the geological, 
hydrogeological framework to enhance geophysical interpretation. Through its own 
database (geoDataBase), pyCSAMT can use true resistivity values, well data as well the 
true layer names into a calculated model from inversion software to give a better accuracy 
in geophysical interpretations rather than interpretations based only on 2D lateral 
resistivity distribution so to predict the layer thickness encountered during survey area, 
the layer name as well as their electrical properties.   we intend for next release to add 
"star gain" tool as intelligent drill predictor.

 
4. Who takes advantage of that software? 
As we introduced the software, the first persons to take advantage of this software are 
the scientific geophysics community, this is why we encourage their suggestions and 
comment to improve the software. Secondly our regards point out to. the community of 
developers and users of that software.  We intend to build interactive graphical interface 
to let freely unfamiliar people with python to easily handle the software. 


5. Synopsis of pyCSAMT sub-packages 

pyCSAMT toolbox is structured in three (03) main sub packages with different roles:  
csamtpy, geodrill and viewer sub-packages. csamtpy sub-packages is mainly focused about 
CSAMT data
 processing and inversion while the geodrill sub-package dealt with geology formations as 
well as  boreholes and wells data. The viewer sub-package only dealt about visualization 
(1D and 2D).
 Overall, the number of sub-packages is estimated at seven (7) which brings basic features 
in classes, methods and functions. pyCSAMT sub_package organization is already 
considering its future extension and the implementation of future projects such as data 
processing in near-field and transition zone where penetration depth does not depend on 
frequency but rather on geometry.
	1.Core sub-package : 
	contains the modules for handling the most basic structures within CSAMT data 
processing (analysis and imaging)
	2. Processing:
	allows for more details inspections of phase tensor ? (Caldwell et al., 1953) as 
impedance tensor Z, the filter application. It is composed of data analysis and imaging as 
well as data correction	 and deal with MTpy open source software(Krieger  and Peacob, 
2014; Kirkby et al, 2019)
3. Utils :   bears scripts and modules, which provide general tips and specific 
functionalities.
4. Modeling  : reads, writes models output files and keeps resistivities data of each 
station as a  function of depth and deals directly with the geoCore sub-package . 
	5. geoCore mainly deals with geological formations (nature of rocks and its 
electrical properties). geoCore is intended to rebuild and plot drilling data obtained from 
investigation area  and it also used to build borehole 
6. geoDB or geodatabase sub-package considers geological data obtained from field and 
integrates information into its own SQL database. geoDB considers different geological 
layer names, layers stations locations, and different 2D inversions results with their 
corresponding parameters.

6. Conclusions 
pyCSAMT provides to the academic geophysics＊ community   basic functionalities for data 
handling, data processing, and interpretation of controlled source magnetotelluric within 
an extensible framework. It is basic tool and at the time paper the ※readme file is written 
＆  the software does not  contain all data processing and analysis form CSAMT method. . 
At the time this paper is written, pyCSAMT source codes are freely available on GIT 
repository. We hope that the overview of this toolbox will bring helps to many people 
working with CSAMT method.
